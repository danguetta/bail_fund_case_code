    "# Automating Bureaucracy with Python - the Case of the Springfield Bail Fund\n",
    "## Instructor workbook\n",
    "(C) 2021, Daniel Guetta\n",

    "_Many thanks to Drew Feldman (CBS '22) for his invaluable assistance in developing the technical aspects of the case._\n",

    "This workbook contains instructor instructions for  running the Springfield Bail Fund case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The case runs in two steps (all specific dates/numbers can be modified in the first section below)\n",
    "  - First, the instructor generates cases from January 2021 to February 2022 at the Springfield court, and sends out all emails that would have been sent in 2021.\n",
    "  - The class happens based on those emails.\n",
    "  - The instructor sends any January 2022 emails, and students carry out the homework based on these new emails\n",
    "  \n",
    "This notebook carries out all these steps. To run it, carry out the following steps\n",
    "  - Modify the \"create parameters\" section if necessary (the most important change - if you're not teaching this case at Columbia - is to change the `EMAIL_FROM` and `EMAIL_TO` varaiables to reflect the gmail account you've set up)\n",
    "  - Download client credentials for the email address you're sending emails _from_, and save them in a file called client_credentials.json\n",
    "  - Run the entire notebook straight through. It will save all emails to a file whose name is specified in the `LEFTOVER_EMAIL_FILE` variable, and send the subject of emails required before class.\n",
    "  - After class, take the commented-out code in the last cell of this workbook, and run it to read the `LEFTOVER_EMAIL_FILE` and send remaining emails"
